# ProSalonPOS — Railway Deployment Guide

**Session V23 — Fixed**

## Overview

ProSalonPOS runs as a single Railway service. The server (Node.js/Express) serves both the API and the built frontend. Railway provisions a PostgreSQL database automatically.

## Repository Structure

```
prosalonpos/                     ← GitHub repo root
├── prosalonpos-station/         ← Frontend (React/Vite)
│   ├── src/
│   ├── package.json
│   └── vite.config.js
└── prosalonpos-server/          ← Backend (Express/Prisma)
    ├── src/
    ├── prisma/
    ├── scripts/build-railway.js
    └── package.json
```

## Railway Settings

| Setting | Value |
|---------|-------|
| **Root Directory** | *(leave BLANK — do NOT set to /prosalonpos-server)* |
| **Build Command** | `cd prosalonpos-server && npm install && node scripts/build-railway.js` |
| **Start Command** | `cd prosalonpos-server && node src/server.js` |

**Why Root Directory must be blank:** Railway needs to see both folders during the build. The build script navigates into `prosalonpos-station/` to install and build the frontend, then copies the output to `prosalonpos-server/public/`. If Root Directory is set, Railway isolates to that folder and the frontend can't be found.

## Environment Variables

| Variable | Value | Notes |
|----------|-------|-------|
| `DATABASE_URL` | *(auto-set by Railway)* | PostgreSQL connection string |
| `JWT_SECRET` | *(auto-generated or set manually)* | Used for auth tokens |
| `PORT` | *(auto-set by Railway)* | Railway assigns this |

## What the Build Script Does

1. `cd prosalonpos-server && npm install` — installs server dependencies
2. `node scripts/build-railway.js` runs:
   - `npx prisma generate` — generates Prisma client
   - `npm install` in `../prosalonpos-station/` — installs frontend deps
   - `npx vite build` in `../prosalonpos-station/` — builds React app
   - Copies `prosalonpos-station/dist/` → `prosalonpos-server/public/`

## What Happens on First Run

1. Prisma creates all database tables
2. Server auto-bootstraps: creates salon with random 6-char code
3. Seeds: 5 categories, 15 services, salon settings, 1 manager
4. Console shows salon code, owner PIN (0000), manager PIN (1234)

## Logging In

1. Open `https://your-app.railway.app`
2. **Station Setup** — enter salon code from Railway deploy logs
3. **Login** — enter PIN `0000` (owner) or `1234` (manager)

## License Check

On Railway (PostgreSQL), license returns `dev_mode` — activation screen is skipped.

## Updating

Push to GitHub → Railway auto-deploys → build script rebuilds frontend + pushes schema.

## Current Instance

- **URL:** prosalonpos-production.up.railway.app
- **Salon code:** 7AVM8Z
- **Owner PIN:** 0000
- **Manager PIN:** 1234
